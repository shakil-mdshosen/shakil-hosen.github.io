# Contact Form Setup Instructions

The contact form on `/contact.html` uses **FormSubmit.co** - a free form submission service that sends emails without requiring backend code.

## ✅ How It Works

1. Users fill out the contact form with their email, subject, and message
2. FormSubmit.co receives the form submission
3. The email is forwarded to **shakil@bnwp.org**

## 🔧 First-Time Activation Required

**Important:** The first time someone submits the contact form, FormSubmit will send a **confirmation email** to shakil@bnwp.org.

### Activation Steps:

1. Have someone submit a test message through the contact form at `https://shakil.engineer/contact.html`
2. Check the inbox for **shakil@bnwp.org**
3. Look for an email from FormSubmit.co with subject "Confirm your email address"
4. Click the confirmation link in the email
5. Once confirmed, all future form submissions will be delivered automatically!
